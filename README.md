ðŸ¤– AI Integration for Teachers

We integrated an AI assistant into the teacher dashboard so teachers can generate helpful resources (summaries, key concepts, quizzes, and exercises) from any file they upload.

Features

âœ¨ AI button beside each resource in the library.

Teachers can choose a mode:

RÃ©sumÃ© (summarize PDF/DOCX/text)

Concepts clÃ©s (extract bullet points)

QCM (generate multiple-choice quiz in JSON)

Exercices + solutions (generate practice problems with answers)

AI preview shows the result before saving.

Teachers can insert the AI output directly into their course folders as a new resource.

How it works

Teacher uploads a resource (PDF, DOCX, image, video, link, etc.).

Click the âœ¨ AI button â†’ select desired mode.

Backend fetches and parses the file:

pdf-parse for PDFs

mammoth for Word DOCX

plain text/HTML for links and text files

empty text for images/videos (the model analyzes the URL itself)

The backend sends a request to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with a tailored prompt.

The generated output is shown in preview.

Teacher can save the result into the chosen section â†’ stored in Supabase Storage and referenced in library_items with kind="other".
